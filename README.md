## 😃 Real-Time Emotion Detection

This is a Python-based real-time face emotion detection system using OpenCV. It detects human faces from webcam input and labels them with an emotion. Currently, it uses a simulated random prediction method (model integration is planned in the next phase).

### 🔧 Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

---

### 🚀 How to Run

Make sure your webcam is connected. Then run:
